### About Me

I am a Information Security Professional and a Linux Systems Administrator. I dedicated seven years to the United States Air Force as Satellite Communication Technician and a Cyber Warfare Operator. Currently I work as a Cyber Security Engineer in the Greater St. Louis Area.

On my personal time I enjoy tinkering with various facets of technology including building PCs, managing personal servers, and training in my lab environment. I also like to compete in hacking competitions, play video games, read comic books, and immerse myself in great stories via movies or TV shows.

Thanks for taking the time to visit!
